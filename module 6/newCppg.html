    <p> This website is a list of my favorite video games that I have played and will be expanded in the future as I continue to play more! I will be adding additional functions in the near future for this
    website that can help to navigate it and maybe even add a forum for people to discuss their favorite games and even comments under the games on my list from users. These new additions will be added soon
  and I hope everyone here has a good time!</p>

    <p> List of games will begin below and be expanded on as time goes by. Keep in mind the site is a work in progress. You can also click the gmaes name to bring you to the official sites for them to support the games if you want.</p>
<div data-role="content">
